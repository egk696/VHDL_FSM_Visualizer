    /* DataEdge is the data class for the edges. It contains all custom edge data specified by the user.
     * This class also must be derived from EdgeBase class that provides properties and methods mandatory for
     * correct GraphX operations.
     * Some of the useful EdgeBase members are:
     *  - ID property that stores unique positive identfication number. Property must be filled by user.
     *  - IsSelfLoop boolean property that indicates if this edge is self looped (eg have identical Target and Source vertices) 
     *  - RoutingPoints collection of points used to create edge routing path. If Null then straight line will be used to draw edge.
     *      In most cases it is handled automatically by GraphX.
     *  - Source property that holds edge source vertex.
     *  - Target property that holds edge target vertex.
     *  - Weight property that holds optional edge weight value that can be used in some layout algorithms.
